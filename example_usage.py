    Meeting: Q4 Product Planning
    Attendees: John Smith (CEO), Maria Garcia (CTO), Alex Johnson (Product Manager)
    
    John: Thanks everyone for joining. We need to finalize our Q4 product roadmap. 
    Maria, what's the status on the AI integration feature?
    
    Maria: We're about 70% complete. The core functionality is working, but we need 
    another 2-3 weeks for testing and optimization. The main challenge is ensuring 
    the AI responses are accurate and fast enough for real-time use.
    
    Alex: From a product perspective, our users are really excited about this feature. 
    We've seen a 40% increase in feature requests related to AI assistance. The main 
    user pain point is that our current system requires too many manual steps.
    
    John: What's the cost impact of this feature?
    
    Maria: We're looking at about $5,000/month in additional cloud costs for the AI 
    services, but we expect this to be offset by increased user engagement and 
    potential premium subscriptions.
    
    Alex: We're planning to launch this as a premium feature at $19.99/month. 
    Based on our market research, this pricing is competitive with similar tools.
    
    John: Sounds good. Let's target a November 15th launch date. Maria, can you 
    provide a detailed timeline by next week?
    
    Maria: Absolutely. I'll have the technical timeline ready by Friday.
    
    Alex: I'll work on the marketing materials and user onboarding flow.
    
    John: Perfect. Next meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday at 10 AM.
