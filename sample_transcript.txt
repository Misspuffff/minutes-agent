Meeting Transcript - Product Development Discussion

Participants: Sarah Johnson (Product Manager), Mike Chen (Lead Developer), Lisa Rodriguez (UX Designer), David Kim (Marketing Director)

Sarah: Thanks everyone for joining today's product planning meeting. We're here to discuss the new mobile app feature that our users have been requesting. Let me start by sharing what we've learned from our user research.

Mike: Before we dive in, I want to make sure we're all aligned on the technical constraints. Our current infrastructure can handle about 10,000 concurrent users, but this new feature might push us to 15,000-20,000 users during peak hours.

Sarah: That's a great point, Mike. From our user interviews, we found that 78% of our active users want real-time collaboration features. The main pain point is that our current app doesn't allow multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously.

Lisa: I've been working on the user experience flow for this. The key challenge is making it intuitive for users to see who else is working on the document and what changes they're making in real-time. We're thinking of using color-coded cursors and live editing indicators.

David: From a marketing perspective, this feature could be a game-changer. Our competitors don't have this capability, and it could help us capture market share from enterprise customers. We're estimating this could increase our monthly recurring revenue by 25-30%.

Mike: Technically, we'll need to implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates, and we'll need to handle conflict resolution when multiple users edit the same section. We're looking at operational transform algorithms, but that's going to require significant development time.

Sarah: What's your estimate on development time, Mike?

Mike: For a basic version with core functionality, I'd say 3-4 months with our current team. For a full-featured version with advanced conflict resolution, probably 6-8 months.

Lisa: I think we should start with the basic version and iterate based on user feedback. We can launch with simple real-time editing and add more sophisticated features in subsequent releases.

David: I agree with Lisa's approach. We can position the basic version as "beta" and use it to generate buzz and gather user feedback. This also aligns with our Q2 launch timeline.

Sarah: That sounds like a solid plan. Let me summarize what we've decided: We'll develop a basic real-time collaboration feature with a 3-4 month timeline, launch it as a beta in Q2, and iterate based on user feedback. Mike, can you start working on the technical architecture document?

Mike: Absolutely. I'll have a draft ready by next week.

Lisa: I'll continue working on the UX mockups and create a user testing plan.

David: I'll start preparing the marketing materials and beta user recruitment strategy.

Sarah: Perfect. Our next meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday at 2 PM. Mike, please bring the technical architecture document, and Lisa, please bring the updated mockups.
